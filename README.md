Nutritional Label - HTML & CSS Project
Project Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of a Nutritional Label using pure HTML and CSS. The label design is inspired by the common nutrition facts section found on food packaging. It mimics the visual structure and format of a real nutrition label, showcasing key nutrients, serving size, and daily value percentages in a clean, responsive layout.

Features
Responsive Design: The nutritional label adjusts its layout to fit different screen sizes.
Accessible HTML Structure: The semantic HTML ensures that the label can be interpreted correctly by screen readers and search engines.
Custom Styling: CSS is used to replicate the official nutritional label format with emphasis on font styles, borders, alignment, and spacing.

HTML File (index.html)
The HTML file uses semantic tags like <section>, <div>, and <span> to organize the various elements of the label such as serving size, calories, nutrients, and daily values.

CSS File (styles.css)
The CSS file contains all the styling needed to format the label, such as:

Typography: Font size, weight, and style to match real-world nutritional labels.
Layout: Flexbox and grid techniques are used for alignment and spacing of different sections.
Borders and Boxes: CSS rules define the boxy structure typical of nutritional labels.
Responsive Media Queries: Ensures the label looks good on both desktop and mobile views.
